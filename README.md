# Security Incident Triage Assistant CLI

A persistent chat interface for Azure OpenAI Assistant with session management, designed specifically for security incident analysis and triage.

## Features

‚úÖ **Persistent Sessions**: Automatically saves and restores your assistant and conversation threads  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS  
‚úÖ **Interactive CLI**: Full-featured command-line interface with helpful commands  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful recovery  
‚úÖ **Session Management**: Maintains context across multiple sessions  
‚úÖ **Security Focus**: Specialized for security incident analysis and KQL queries  

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Azure OpenAI account with deployed model
- Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint

## Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project directory with your Azure OpenAI credentials:
   ```env
   ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the assistant:**
   ```bash
   python assistant.py
   ```
   
   Or use the launcher script:
   ```bash
   python run_assistant.py
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Assistant

When you first run the application, it will:
- Connect to Azure OpenAI
- Create a new security assistant (or restore existing one)
- Start a new conversation thread (or continue previous one)
- Display a welcome message with available commands

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | Show available commands and examples |
| `new` | Start a new conversation thread |
| `quit` or `exit` | Exit the application (saves session) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quick exit with session save |

### Example Interactions

```
üí¨ You: Analyze incident INC-12345
ü§ñ Assistant: I'd be happy to help you analyze incident INC-12345...

üí¨ You: Show me KQL to find failed logins
ü§ñ Assistant: Here's a KQL query to find failed login attempts...

üí¨ You: What entities are involved in the current incident?
ü§ñ Assistant: Based on our previous discussion about INC-12345...
```

## Session Management

The assistant automatically manages sessions through a hidden file in your home directory (`.security_assistant_session.json`). This enables:

- **Assistant Persistence**: Reuses the same assistant configuration across sessions
- **Conversation Continuity**: Maintains conversation history and context
- **Automatic Recovery**: Handles cases where assistants or threads no longer exist

## File Structure

```
chat-development/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assistant.py           # Main CLI application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_assistant.py      # Launcher script with checks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                 # Azure OpenAI credentials (you create this)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## Dependencies

- `openai` - Azure OpenAI Python SDK
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

## Cross-Platform Support

This CLI works on all major platforms:

- **Windows**: Run with `python assistant.py` or `py assistant.py`
- **Linux/macOS**: Run with `python3 assistant.py` or make executable with `chmod +x assistant.py && ./assistant.py`

## Security Features

The assistant is specifically designed for security incident analysis with:

- Built-in understanding of security incident workflows
- KQL query generation and optimization
- Azure Sentinel integration knowledge
- Entity analysis and correlation
- Investigation timeline creation
- Pattern recognition and threat hunting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing .env file**:
   ```
   ‚ùå Error: Missing required environment variables.
   ```
   **Solution**: Create a `.env` file with your Azure OpenAI credentials.

2. **Invalid credentials**:
   ```
   ‚ùå Failed to initialize Azure OpenAI client
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify your `ENDPOINT_URL` and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

3. **Assistant no longer exists**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Previous assistant no longer exists, creating new one...
   ```
   **Solution**: This is normal - the CLI will automatically create a new assistant.

### Getting Help

- Use the `help` command within the CLI for usage instructions
- Check that your Azure OpenAI deployment is active and accessible
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
